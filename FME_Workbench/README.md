# Intorduction

This folder contains the imageCastle.fmw FME workbench which Reads the Image Castle 3D Model (the DWG), Integrate it with the images, and Write a *.FMEAR file.

The current imageCastle.fmw is built by FME 2019.1 and uses First Feature (here the Base) for anchoring to the surfaced dected by FME AR App.

A newer release of the Workbench using View Points, built by FME 2020, is coming soon (no need for the Base).

# How your Images Must be Named - Very Important ;)

All of the images can be those of yours. Just decide where you'd like your images to show up and name them according to the following plan and images :

* Enterance Hall : 12 images on the walls (1.jpg, 2.jpg ... 12.jpg)
* Middle Hall : 6 images on the wall (13.jpg, 14.jpg ... 17.jpg) AND 1 images for the ceiling part (32.jpg)
* Exit Hall : 12 images on the walls (19.jpg, 20.jpg ... 30.jpg)
* Outside between the Entrance and Exit : 1 image (image 31)
* Outside further down the Entrance : 3 images (100.jpg, 101.jpg, and 102,jpg). These can be used for adding credits ...

* To make sure the Walls and Base are rendered properly and Appearnces are not mixed please donwload images 200.jpg and 201.jpg from the [General_Texture](https://github.com/AlborzZamyadi/FME_AR_ImageCastle/tree/master/Images/General_Texture) folder. In AR mode, the Base will show up almost fully transpraent.
